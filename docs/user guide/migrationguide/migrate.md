# Migration Guide

In order to take advantage of all the latest features in the 2.1.0 release, projects need to be migrated to the 2.1.0 release.

Migration of a project is not required. All project will continue to function at the previous level of functionality. New features may appear non-functional or incomplete, however, until the project has been migrated.

> **Note**: The migration process must be performed by each Quick Model View Manager on each of the projects they have created.

To migrate a project:

1. Follow the steps in [How to Migrate a Project](../projectmaker/migrateproject.md) to migrate the project to the new release.
