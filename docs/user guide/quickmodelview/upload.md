# How to Upload a Model

**For instructions on installing and using the plugins to upload a model to your project please visit the documentation on [twinit.dev](https://twinit.dev/docs/concepts/plug-ins/ipa-plugins)**

> **Note**: If you already have a bimpk file, created from your model, you can upload it to your project using the upload button at the top of the Import Model page.
