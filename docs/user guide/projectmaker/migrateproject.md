# How to Migrate a Project

1. Sign in to your Quick Model View Manager project

Any projects that can be migrated will appear in the list with an 'Update Project' button. Currently, you may only migrate projects that you created.

2. Click the migrate button to start the migration of the project

The list will expand to display the steps of the migration as they complete. Once the migration finishes the project will display with a green circle indicating it is up to date.

3. Click the (x) icon to close the migration log

> **IMPORTANT**: Do not refresh or leave the page while a migration is running, as it will cancel the migration and result in an incomplete migration of the project. In most cases the migration can be run again on the project if the migration was interrupted.
