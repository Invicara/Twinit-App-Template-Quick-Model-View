# Deploy the Updated Web Client

The steps to deploy the updated web client are identical to building a deploying the web client the first time.

See these steps in the deployment guide:

1. [Build and Run the Web Client](./deploy/d3-webclient.md)
2. [Test the Template](./deploy/d4-test.md)
3. [Deploy the Web Client for Users](./deploy/d5-deploy-to-cloud.md)

Be sure that your build process includes running

```
npm install
```

as the updated version of the client requires some new node packages to be installed.
